MNIST on Kubeflow on GCP

Follow these instructions to run the MNIST tutorial on GCP

    Follow the GCP instructions to deploy Kubeflow with IAP

    Launch a Jupyter notebook
        The tutorial has been tested using the Jupyter Tensorflow 1.15 image

    Launch a terminal in Jupyter and clone the kubeflow examples repo

    git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/examples.git git_kubeflow-examples

        Tip When you start a terminal in Jupyter, run the command bash to start a bash terminal which is much more friendly then the default shell

        Tip You can change the URL from '/tree' to '/lab' to switch to using Jupyterlab
